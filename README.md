# Introduction

This repo is meant to digitize the data within the Lunar Compendium. It looks at all of the sample data `https://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/samples/#catalogues,` on the PDFs of this website. It uses a PDF scraper to take the data within the first `Table 1` which contains the information on sample characteristics. It also pulls in the api sample data from `https://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/rest/lunarapi/samples/sampledetails/`. This is all combined into the file `ouputs\final_out.csv`.
